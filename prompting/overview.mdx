Clear prompts ensure Jina accurately achieves your intended outcomes. Jina accommodates both exploratory and explicit testing.

- **Exploratory**: Jina autonomously explores multiple paths to achieve a goal. Ideal for broad goal-based testing (e.g., verifying all valid checkout flows in an e-commerce scenario).
- **Explicit**: Focuses precisely on one granular flow for highly targeted tests.

## **Explicit prompts**:

Clearly identify UI elements by location and context. 

Example: "Click the submit button in the top right corner, next to the info card." 

This provides specific, relational context for precision.

## **Exploratory prompts**:

Clearly define the objective. Example: "Go through the buying flow and purchase a t-shirt." Always maintain a singular, clear goal per test scenario.

For multiple objectives, split into separate test cases to ensure clarity and accuracy.

## **Assertions**:

Always explicitly state assertions in natural language using terms like "Verify" or "Make sure." This clarity allows Jina to determine pass/fail outcomes.

Limit each test to a single assertion. Multiple assertions indicate the need to separate into distinct test cases.

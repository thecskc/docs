Clear prompts ensure Jina accurately achieves your intended outcomes. Jina accommodates both exploratory and explicit testing.

- **Exploratory**: Jina autonomously explores multiple paths to achieve a goal. Ideal for broad goal-based testing (e.g., verifying all valid checkout flows in an e-commerce scenario).
- **Explicit**: Focuses precisely on one granular flow for highly targeted tests.

Jina can perform both specific and exploratory testing, depending significantly on the quality and clarity of your prompts. Below is one example framework for structuring prompts. 

You can prompt in any free-form language that feels intuitive, but having a clear structure can significantly improve your testing outcomes.

- **Context**: Provide detailed context about your product, your company, and relevant background information.
- **Objective**: Clearly define the objective of your test. It can be beneficial to frame this as a user story for clarity.
- **Instructions**:
  - Outline individual test steps.
  - Use atomic instructions where relevant, such as "Click," "Type," or "Scroll."
  - Clearly identify UI elements by their location and context. For instance, specify "Click the submit button in the top right corner, next to the info card."
- **Assertions**:
  - Explicitly state conditions you want Jina to verify.
  - Clearly use keywords such as "Assert" or "Verify" to indicate assertions.
- **Special Instructions**:
  - Include instructions that you specifically want Jina to remember or adhere to throughout the test flow, such as handling popups (e.g., "Hit escape when a popup is encountered.") or isolating certain flows for individual treatment.

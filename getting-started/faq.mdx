## Getting Started

### What type of tests is Jina a good fit for?

Jina excels at functional end-to-end tests where you want to verify that your application works as intended. You can run:

- **Regression tests** - Ensure existing functionality continues to work after changes
- **New feature tests** - Validate that new features work correctly
- **Exploratory tests** - Discover edge cases and unexpected user flows

You can run all these tests either exploratory (letting Jina discover multiple paths) or deterministically (following specific step-by-step instructions).

**Jina isn't ideal for cases such as:**
- Complex data validation requiring backend data comparison with frontend displays
- Precise counting tasks (while LLMs can count, Jina's AI-based inference doesn't provide code-level guarantees for exact numerical assertions)
- Tests requiring direct database or API manipulation outside the browser



### What's the difference between exploratory and explicit testing?

- **Exploratory testing**: You give Jina a high-level goal, and it autonomously explores multiple paths to achieve it. Perfect for testing "all valid ways to complete checkout."
- **Explicit testing**: You provide detailed step-by-step instructions for Jina to follow precisely. Ideal for testing specific user flows exactly as specified.

Both approaches use natural language prompts - the difference is in how much detail and control you provide.

## Technical Setup

### We have a firewall for our staging/test environments. How do you handle this?

To access internal environments, you can use a tunnel to create an access-controlled URL that only our agents can reach:

- **Recommended**: Use Cloudflare Tunnel or ngrok for quick setup
- **Alternative**: Set up a VPN gateway into your staging environment (requires more effort)

The tunnel approach is usually the most practical solution. For stricter network constraints, our team will work with you to find the right approach.

### Can I run this on-premises?

Currently, Jina is cloud-based only. We require a URL that our browser agents can visit over the internet. This allows us to provide the most reliable and up-to-date testing infrastructure without requiring local setup or maintenance.

### What browsers does Jina support?

Jina supports Chromium-based browsers. This provides consistent, reliable test results across different environments and ensures compatibility with modern web applications.

## Test Management

### Can I run setup or teardown tests?

While Jina doesn't directly support setup/teardown scripts, you can work around this by:

1. Adding setup/teardown buttons to your application interface
2. Having Jina click these buttons as part of the test flow
3. Having those buttons trigger the necessary scripts

This way, Jina can trigger setup and teardown operations when needed as part of the natural test flow.

### How do I handle authentication in my tests?

Jina integrates with most major authentication providers using their test user functionality:

- **Standard auth providers** (Auth0, Clerk, Privy, Dynamic, etc.): We use dedicated test credentials
- **Custom auth flows**: Our team will collaborate with you to define a secure integration
- **Session persistence**: Jina maintains login state across test runs

For custom 2FA or special authentication requirements, we can work with you to implement secure workarounds.

### What happens when my UI changes?

Unlike traditional test automation that breaks with UI changes, Jina adapts because it:

- Uses vision and reasoning instead of brittle CSS selectors
- Understands content and context, not just DOM structure
- Can often adapt existing tests to UI changes automatically
- Focuses on user-visible outcomes rather than technical implementation details

When significant changes occur, you may need to update your test prompts, but the underlying test logic often remains valid.

## Features and Capabilities

### Can Jina handle file uploads and downloads?

File handling capabilities are coming soon. Currently, focus on testing user flows that don't require file manipulation, or use workarounds like having files pre-staged in your test environment.

### Can you handle mobile testing?

Currently, Jina performs browser-based testing only. We focus on desktop and responsive web application testing through standard web browsers.

### How do I test different user roles and permissions?

You can test different user roles by:

1. **Specifying user context** in your prompts: "Login as admin-user@example.com. This user has full administrative privileges."
2. **Testing role-specific features**: Verify that certain features are only visible to appropriate user types
3. **Multi-user scenarios**: Test collaboration features by switching between different user accounts during the test

### Can I schedule tests to run automatically?

Yes, Jina supports scheduling tests to run automatically. You can set up recurring test runs and include necessary authentication details to ensure seamless execution without manual intervention.

### How do I handle dynamic content?

For applications with frequently changing data:

- Focus on UI layout and functionality rather than specific data values
- Use assertions that check for data format and structure, not exact values
- Test both empty states and populated states when possible
- Allow reasonable wait times for content to load (typically 5-10 seconds)

## Prompting and Best Practices

### How do I write effective prompts for Jina?

Good prompts include:

- **Clear context** about your product and the testing scenario
- **Specific objectives** written as user stories
- **Detailed instructions** with explicit UI element references
- **Meaningful assertions** that verify important user outcomes

You can use our suggested framework or write in freeform natural language - whatever feels most intuitive for your team.

### How does test versioning work?

- Test steps remain unchanged between runs unless you explicitly edit the prompt
- When you update a test prompt, Jina creates a new version
- Previous versions are preserved for reference or rollback
- This ensures consistency while allowing evolution of your test suite

### How do I test error scenarios?

Test error handling by:

1. Intentionally triggering errors (invalid form data, network interruptions)
2. Verifying appropriate error messages display
3. Ensuring users can recover from error states
4. Checking that errors don't break subsequent functionality

Include error scenario testing in your prompts for comprehensive coverage.

## Security and Data

### Is my data secure with Jina?

Yes, we implement comprehensive security measures:

- **Data ownership**: You retain full ownership of all data
- **Strict confidentiality**: All personnel sign confidentiality agreements
- **No unauthorized use**: Data is only used for delivering testing services
- **Third-party controls**: AI tools process data in real-time without storage or training

See our [Security and Privacy](/platform/security-privacy) documentation for complete details.

### What data does Jina access during testing?

Jina only accesses what's visible in the browser during testing:
- Screenshots for visual analysis
- DOM structure for element identification
- Network requests visible to the browser
- Any data you explicitly include in test credentials

Jina doesn't access backend databases, server logs, or data outside the browser context.

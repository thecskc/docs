Welcome to Jina! This guide will help you get up and running with AI-powered QA testing in just a few minutes.

## What is Jina?

Jina is your AI QA engineer that automatically browses your app like real users, runs end-to-end tests, and catches bugs autonomously. No test scripts or CSS selectors required.

## Getting Started

### 1. Sign Up

Visit [usejina.com](https://usejina.com) to create your account and get access to the platform.

### 2. Connect Your App

Once you get access to the dashboard, add your application URL to start testing. Jina works with web applications:
- Staging environments  
- Production sites (with care)

### 3. Create Your First Test

Write your first test case in plain English:

```
Test the user registration flow:
1. Navigate to the signup page
2. Fill out the registration form with valid information
3. Submit the form
4. Verify the user is redirected to the dashboard
5. Assert that a welcome message is displayed
```

### 4. Run and Review

Jina will:
- Generate test steps automatically
- Execute the test in a real browser
- Provide detailed results and screenshots
- Catch visual and functional issues

Jina is your AI QA engineer. It spins up AI users that browse your app like real people, run end-to-end tests, and catch bugs autonomously, at scale. It understands UI, code, and user intent. Doesn't rely on test scripts or CSS selectors and requires no maintenance.

# Problem

QA is critical. You want to catch bugs before your users do and ship fast with confidence. But today’s testing workflows are broken:

### 🧠 Test Case Design is a Mental Burden

**Engineers and QA teams spend a lot of time thinking through what to test**. Designing comprehensive test cases takes deep product context and is often slow and error-prone.

### ⌛ Writing Scripts is Time-Consuming

Even after identifying what to test, converting those cases into working test scripts takes even longer. And despite the effort, **many edge cases and important flows still get missed.**

### 🔧 Testing Requires Painful Ongoing Maintenance

Test scripts are fragile. Even small UI changes cause them to break, triggering a cycle of constant debugging and rewriting. Instead of being a safety net, **testing becomes a maintenance burden that slows teams down.**

Even “no-code” tools still rely solely on these fragile scripts behind the scenes.

# Jina

Jina is an AI QA Engineer that eliminates test scripts entirely. It navigates your app using agentic reasoning and natural language, dynamically exploring user flows like a real person would. 

### 🤖  Proactive Test Suggestions

Jina recommends test cases based on:

- **Code changes** – Detects updates and suggests what to test
- **User behavior** – Analyzes real usage to surface likely flows

### ✅  Write tests in plain english

You can describe test scenarios using natural language and be as exploratory or explicit as you'd like. No need to write code or use test scripts.

#### 🔍  Broader, More Resilient Test Coverage

Jina explores **multiple valid paths** for a test case when available, not just one, helping you cover more ground with each scenario.

### 🔧  No Test Maintenance Required

Test design is vision first and doesn't rely on selectors or brittle scripts, so they don’t break when your UI changes and can be easily recreated with the click of a button.

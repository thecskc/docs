title: "Authentication"
---

For authenticated test scenarios, our platform integrates with your authentication provider using secure, standard-compliant methods.

- By default, we authenticate our AI test users using the **test user functionality** provided by most major auth providers (e.g., Stytch, Clerk, Privy, Dynamic, Auth0). These providers typically offer dedicated test credentials that can be used safely in staging or development environments.
- We securely store these test credentials and persist the session state within our platform, so that your AI test agents can remain logged in across test runs without re-authenticating each time.
- When a test scenario is marked as requiring an authenticated session, our agents automatically use the stored credentials to log in before proceeding with the test.

<Note>
  If your app uses a custom auth flow, weâ€™re happy to collaborate to define a secure and reliable integration.

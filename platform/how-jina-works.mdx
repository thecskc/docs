Jina is your AI QA engineer. It explores your app like a real user and builds test cases from natural language prompts. 

Here's how it works:

## 1. Test Cases Start with Exploration

Jina doesn't require predefined scripts. It begins by exploring your app based on your promptâ€”simulating realistic user behavior to uncover flows.

## 2. Built with Primitive Actions

Test cases are composed of primitive actions like click, scroll, and type.

- Each action is executed as a Playwright code snippet
- This ensures code-level reliability and native browser control
- [View all supported actions](/primitive-actions)

## 3. Assertions Powered by LLMs

Assertions are generated automatically using:

- **The DOM** - Structural elements and content
- **The accessibility tree** - Semantic understanding of UI components  
- **Screenshots from the UI** - Visual validation and context

These inputs help Jina create intelligent, contextual checks without manual effort.

## 4. Fully Editable Test Steps

Jina gives you full control over your test cases:

- **Review and edit** each step before running
- **Modify primitive actions** directly when needed
- **Skip or replace** Jina-generated steps with your own

## 5. Fast and Deterministic by Default

All actions are cached at test creation for:

- **Deterministic replay** - Consistent results across runs
- **Faster execution** - No need to re-evaluate cached actions
- **Stable references** - Reliable selectors and element targeting

## 6. Self-Healing for Changing UIs

When your app changes and selectors break, Jina can self-heal:

- **Natural language descriptions** - Each step stores a human-readable description
- **Dynamic element detection** - If a selector is missing, Jina re-evaluates the UI to find a matching element
- **Adaptive testing** - Test cases adapt to new layouts and minor UI updates without requiring full rewrites

## Key Advantages

- **No Selector Maintenance**: Tests don't break when your UI changes because Jina understands visual context and content, not just DOM selectors.
- **Intelligent Navigation**: Jina can adapt to different user paths and UI states, making tests more resilient to application changes.
- **Human-Like Testing**: By using vision and reasoning, Jina can catch visual bugs and usability issues that traditional automated tests miss.
- **Reduced Test Maintenance**: When your application evolves, Jina can often adapt existing tests rather than requiring complete rewrites.

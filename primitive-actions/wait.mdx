# wait

✅ **Purpose**

Waits a specified number of seconds before continuing, useful for animations, loading delays, or timing buffers.

## 🧩 Syntax

```typescript
{
  description: string,  // Why you're waiting
  seconds: number       // How long to wait (in seconds)
}
```

## 💬 Agent Example

```
"Wait 3 seconds for the animation to finish."
```

## 🛠️ Translated Primitive

```typescript
{
  type: "wait",
  params: {
    description: "animation to finish",
    seconds: 3
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  Use wait actions sparingly and only when necessary, as they can slow down test execution.

# Test Case

A Test Case defines your testing objective and the specific steps you want Jina to follow.

When you set up a Test Case, Jina generates multiple **Test Flows** to explore different ways of achieving your goal. Each Test Flow represents a unique path or scenario for testing your app.

Behind the scenes, each Test Flow version is automatically turned into a **Test Script** by Jina. You can execute these Test Flows multiple times—manually, scheduled, or integrated into your CI/CD pipeline.

# Version Changes

When your website or application changes, updating your tests is straightforward:

- Today, you need to manually re-run the affected Test Flow. Jina will then adjust and generate a new Test Flow version that works with your updated app. In the near future, Jina will proactively detect changes, automatically update the test flow, and either notify you or request your approval—making the process even more hands-off.
- The updated Test Flow again translates into a fresh Test Script internally.

If necessary, you can also create an entirely new Test Case at the top level to regenerate all associated Test Flows.
